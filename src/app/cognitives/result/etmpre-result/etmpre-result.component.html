            The chart below indicates the results of how you rated all items on the electronic team role preference instrument. The bars
            represent the strength of your preference for a particular role (i.e. preferred way of thinking and acting when
            interacting with other members of a team) Most people will have one or two long bars. The longest bar indicates
            their preferred (primary) pattern of thinking and behaving in a team environment. Some people may have two, three,
            or even four bars of similar length, which indicates their comfort level for those roles. For example, people
            with creator, executor, and refiner bars of equal length are very comfortable fulfilling all three roles. People
            with four bars of equal length are able to fulfill the flexer role quite effectively.

        <div fxFlex="100">
            Becoming aware of your own preferences, as well as the preferences of other members of a team, can help you:
            <ul>
                <li>Better understand why you prefer a particular role on a team;</li>
                <li>Contribute to the team’s ability to solve Problem A while managing problem B<sup>2</sup>;</li>
                <li>Enhance the overall team performance (i.e. make the sum greater than the whole);</li>
                <li>Lead teams more effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            Do <strong>NOT</strong> confuse preferred role with ability—we all have the ability to fulfill any one of the
            roles—we just prefer the role that feels most comfortable and natural to us. Never pigeon-hole yourself or others
            by assuming people can only fulfill one role on a team.

            Team leaders and team members are more effective when they recognize and utilize the “Z-process” and account for the Panic-Elation-Panic
            cycle. What follows are brief descriptions for each role, which are a combination of two approaches. Read each
            description, and then self-validate the results from the Role Preference Chart (i.e. Primary and Secondary preferences).
            <br /><br />
            <hr>
            <strong>Stages of the “Z” Process</strong>
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Creating</strong>: During this stage, new ideas are born. Team members look at problems from perspectives
            that are unusual and unique. Discussions are conceptual and focus on the "big picture.” The atmosphere is receptive,
            open, and uncritical.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Advancing</strong> : During this stage, the team gives new ideas more structure and considers broad strategies
            for implementation. The team communicates its ideas to the larger group in an effort to show everyone how the
            idea is valuable and clarify the role they might play in the project.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Refining</strong> : During this stage, the team scrutinizes new ideas to see if they are realistic. The
            team analyzes in an orderly fashion to find flaws and avoid problems down the road. Detailed plans for implementation
            are developed and evaluated.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Executing</strong> : During this stage, the team puts ideas into action; following through on the plan
            to get concrete results. The team focuses on details and makes progress through an orderly, well-thought-out
            process.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>The PEP Cycle</strong> The P.E.P Cycle begins with the call for ideas in order to reach a specified team
            goal. At this point, all team members panic as they attempt to come up with ideas. When brainstorming begins,
            the Creator’s Panic lasts only a few seconds as they immediately visualize all the possibilities and produce
            ideas. Other members come up with ideas too, but the Creators are almost always the first to respond with new
            and innovative ideas. Creators quickly move up the “bell curve” to Elation as every idea is a “great idea” to
            a Creator.
            <hr>
            <br />However, without the Advancers’ encouragement, (or encouragement from the team leader) even creators
            return to Panic. Advancers help Creators by offering support and encouragement without critical judgment.
            <br /><br /> When other team members come up with an idea, they also move from Panic to Elation simply because
            they “thought of something” but most quickly return to Panic because they immediately begin doubting their own
            ideas.
            <br /><br /> When brainstorming begins, Refiners are usually unable to offer any ideas until they have more information
            and so they remain in Panic mode. Therefore, instead of generating ideas, Refiners observe the interaction between
            the Creators and Advancers, scrutinizing (analyzing) every proposal. They examine ideas, considering facts and
            logic, to determine whether they are reasonable.
            <br /><br /> Some of the ideas may be confirmed as unacceptable which will cause Creators to “slide” back to
            a state of Panic until the next “great idea” evolves.
            <br /><br /> Ideas often bounce back and forth among the Creators, Advancers, and Refiners in what’s called the
            “Z” process. The Creator comes up with an idea and as the Advancer begins promoting it, the Refiner begins analyzing
            it.
            <br /><br /> The idea might go back and forth several times before the Refiner (along with the Creator and Advancer)
            agree the idea is ready to pass off to the Executor who has been waiting for an idea to come to fruition (realization)
            then moves the idea into production. Flexers assist the other roles by satisfying the unfulfilled needs of the
            team in order to reach the goal.
            <br /><br /> Effective management is required throughout the cycle to make sure the team succeeds. Without continuous
            leadership involvement and oversight, Creators are likely to continue developing ideas, gaining support from
            the Advancers and criticism from the Refiners. In the meantime, the Executor waits impatiently idle, waiting
            for the call to action. It is up to the team leader to:
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize when Creators (as well as all team members) reach Elation, and look to the Advancer to help move
                    the idea forward before panic sets in again</li>
                <li>Involve and encourage Refiners at the appropriate time, to ensure ideas/solutions are feasible, and if not,
                    eliminated
                </li>
                <li>To utilize the creator-advancer-refiner loop of the Z-process as many times as necessary to ensure that only
                    sound, feasible ideas/solutions are handed off to the executor for implementation</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <sup> 1</sup> Researchers, Allen N. Fahden and Srinivasan Namakkal, first posited that people have a preferred
            approach to thinking and behaving when in a team environment. Over the past two decades, empirical research by
            Inscape Publishing has supplemented Fahden and Namakkal’s research.
            <br />
            <sup>2</sup> Problem A vs. B: Problem A is the agreed common problem for which any team is formed. Problem B
            is any problem that impedes progress towards resolution of Problem A. Note: two problem As make a Problem B and
            all sub-problems within Problem A need resolving such that they do not impede the solution of other sub-problems
            (create Problem B) - a key leadership concern.
