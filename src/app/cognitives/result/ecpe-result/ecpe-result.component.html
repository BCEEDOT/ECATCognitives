      There are six cognitive preferences from strongly, moderately, and mildly adaptive to strongly, moderately, and mildly innovative.
      Your results provide an estimate of where you lie in terms of your cognitive preference for structure.
      <br /><br /> As we move from left to right along the spectrum, the preference for structure decreases<sup>1</sup>.
      Therefore, a person whose cognitive preference is mildly innovative prefers more structure than a person whose cognitive
      preference is moderately innovative; that same person prefers less structure than someone whose cognitive preference
      is moderately adaptive– and so on. In other words, it is relative! Remember, the e-CPE provides only an estimate of
      your cognitive preference. For more accuracy regarding your preference, make arrangements to take the KAI®. by contacting
      a KAI practitioner through the www.kaicentre.com web site.
      <br /><br /> To learn more you can read Dr. Kirton’s book (Adaption-Innovation in the Context of Diversity and Change,
      London: Routledge, 2011). To gain an appreciation for how your creative style affects your life in different ways and
      contexts, look over the descriptions in Table 1 and judge for yourself how each description/behavior applies to you.
      You may find it helpful to draw a line through any descriptions that do not sound like you at all, and then underline,
      circle, or highlight those that do. If your preference is mildly adaptive or mildly innovative, you may be comfortable
      with descriptions/behaviors in both columns. If you are moderately adaptive or moderately innovative, you are probably
      comfortable with many of the descriptions/behaviors in one column, but may also be comfortable with a few of the descriptions/behaviors
      in the other column. If you are strongly adaptive or strongly innovative, then you are probably comfortable with most
      or all of the descriptions/behaviors in one column and may not be comfortable with any descriptions from the other
      column.

      <b>Introduction & Background: What is Cognitive Preference?</b>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="start start" class="text-md pad-sm">
    <div fxFlex="100">
      Cognitive Preference is a stable preference that reflects the characteristic manner in which you solve problems, make decisions,
      and seek to bring about change. In other words, it reflects the way in which you are creative. Among general populations
      (and across continents and cultures), cognitive style preference spans a wide bipolar spectrum in a normal distribution,
      ranging from those with a strong preference for structure to those with a weak preference for structure. M. J. Kirton1-3,
      one of the leading scholars in this field, uses the terms “highly adaptive” and “highly innovative” to describe these
      two poles, respectively, with most people falling somewhere in between (see Note). For accuracy, we use the terms “more
      adaptive” and “more innovative” to describe our style preferences relative to others.
      <br /><br /> Note: It is important to note that “innovation” in the popular sense (i.e., the realization of ideas)
      is different from Kirton’s definition of the term. From the cognitive style perspective, both more adaptive and more
      innovative people regularly realize novel ideas (i.e., “innovate”), but they do so in different ways – and their ideas
      are novel in different ways as well!

      No position along the cognitive preference spectrum is ideal in general, as complex problem solving and creative endeavors
      require a diversity of cognitive style preference for success overall. Cognitive style preference is independent of
      creative level (e.g., intelligence, knowledge, skills, expertise), which means that people of all levels can be found
      at all places along the style spectrum – and vice versa. Your cognitive style preference does not change during your
      lifetime, although you can (and will) behave in ways that do not align with your style when you have sufficient motive
      to do so; called coping behavior, it comes at an extra personal cost.

      The online e-CPE was developed by Mr. Rich Rafferty and Dr. Stephen Harris at the Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, United
      States Air Force, in collaboration<sup>1</sup> with Dr. Kathryn Jablokow, Penn State University. It provides
      only a general estimate of your cognitive style preference. A more specific and psychometrically accurate evaluation
      of your cognitive style preference can be obtained through the KAI® (created by M. J. Kirton), which must be administered
      by a certificated practitioner. Nevertheless, the e-CPE has been shown to correlate quite well with official KAI results
      and can provide useful insights in concert with a clear explanation of the underlying theory. It simulates self-assessment
      exercises often used by practitioners in academic and corporate workshops to give participants a general sense of their
      cognitive preference/ creative style.

      <sup>1</sup>Remember that no one can exist with no structure or within a completely rigid system! The real world lies
      between the two.

  <div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="start start" class="text-md pad-sm">
    <ul>
      <li>Problem A vs. B: Problem A is the agreed common problem for which any team is formed. Problem B is any problem that
        impedes progress towards resolution of Problem A. Note: two problem As make a Problem B and all sub-problems within
        Problem A need resolving such that they do not impede the solution of other sub-problems (create Problem B) - a key
        leadership concern.</li>
      <li>Paradox of Structure: Cognitive structure (paradigm) is both enabling and limiting.</li>
      <li>Cognitive Gap: The gap in style (as well as level, motive, attitude, etc.) between problem solvers and the problem
        and between the problem-solvers themselves, which needs to be resolved in order to problem solve alone or in teams.
        For example, the expected behaviors and differences that exist between a strong Adaptor and a mild Innovator.</li>
      <li>Coping Behavior: Behavior that is not in accord with a one’s preferred style or comfortable reach of current level.
        Comes with a cost i.e. stress.</li>
      <li>Bridgers: Bridgers are those who have intermediate position (or can simulate it) between specific individuals and groups
        (wherever these may lie on the AI continuum), so appearing neutral, and to be willing to bridge, with appropriate
        skill.
      </li>
      <li>Cognitive Style: Synonymous with “cognitive preference”, it is the preferred style (“in what manner") individuals approach
        problem solving (and creativity): highly resistant to change (i.e. preference does not change, but behavior does
        - see cognitive technique and coping behavior)</li>
      <li>Cognitive Techniques: Methods aimed at releasing potential capacity (enhancing level) or simulating a particular needed
        style. They are used when potential capacity is being blocked (anxiety, fatigue) or when preferred style is perceived
        as inappropriate to the problem.</li>
      <li>Collaboration: The diverse characteristics of each style provide robust opportunity for collaboration when each person
        understands what their style preference contributes. With this understanding, each person can create rich, though
        not always simple and easy, collaboration.</li>
