            This report provides scores based on your answers for each of the four dimensions of Transformational Leadership, the two
            dimensions of Transactional Leadership, and the Absence of Leadership. This report also provides composite scores
            for each of the dimensions so that you may compare your scores to others who have taken the e-SALB.
            <br /> The self-response and class average scores derive from a 5-point Likert scale and the percentile rank
            compares you to your peers in the current class. The composite average and composite percentile allow you to
            see how you compare to the general population of people who have taken the e-SALB as of the date of this report.
            In general, higher scores equal greater effectiveness in that area, except for Laissez Faire, where low scores
            are desirable.
            <br/> This report includes an explanation of each leadership style, along with a short explanation of how you
            might enhance your ability to be more effective across the range of FRLD areas. This information is especially
            important for individuals who wish to create a personal leadership development plan (PLDP).

            Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) delivered and validated the original version (called LPM-360) of this instrument.
            They subjected the instrument to more than four years of rigorous scientific study and benchmarked it against
            other leading leadership development instruments. They found the LPM-360 to be superior in almost every way.
            <br /><br /> However, because AFIT designed the original instrument for military officers, it contained a great
            deal of officer-centric language. With this in mind, we developed the e-SALBI with language to encompass all
            members of society.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>CAUTION</strong>: Regardless of its design and validity, no instrument can possibly measure every dimension
            associated with something as broad and as complex as leadership. In addition, psychometric assessments are ‘self-assessments’,
            therefore, results are only as accurate as the honesty of the individual completing the instrument. Keep this
            in mind as you interpret your results. Just because your e-SALBI results are lower (or higher) than expected,
            that does not necessarily mean you are an ineffective (or a very effective) leader. First, ask yourself whether
            you were completely honest when completing the instrument. If not, consider re-accomplishing it. Next, by looking
            at how you compare to others, you can choose areas to include in your PLDP.

            Leadership is the process of influencing others to achieve specific goals. Although there are myriad of leadership theories,
            the Full Range Leadership theory encompasses both the transformational and transformational leadership concepts.
            <br /><br /> Described as charismatic or visionary leadership, transformational leaders maintain a strong personal
            connection with followers. They consistently practice Idealized Influence (II), Inspirational Motivation (IM),
            Intellectual Stimulation (IS), and Individual Consideration (IE).
            <br /><br /> Describes as reward and mistake oriented, transactional leaders view their relationship with subordinates
            as a contract void of emotion. This leader sets performance expectations, monitors progress, and then rewards
            those who achieve the agreed upon outcome(s).
            <br /><br /> Finally, leaders should avoid (in most circumstances) Laissez-Faire leadership, which is described
            as the absence of leadership.
