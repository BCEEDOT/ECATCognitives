            This style involves giving sacrificing your own goals, or giving into the wishes of the other party to mitigate or even eliminate
            the conflict. People who prefer this style use phrases like: "Whatever you want is fine with me.”
            <br /><br /> When you are involved in a conflict situation where you have stake in the outcome, then this style
            may be appropriate. However, if this style is the only one you utilize, then you would be wise to learn how to
            use the other styles to become more effective in handling situations involving conflict.

            This style involves behaviors that either ignore or refuse to engage in the conflict. Although some consider this a negative
            style because the people using it demonstrate little or no concern for the interests of the parties involved,
            including their own. However, there are times when this style is appropriate and/or prudent. For example, it
            is appropriate when the relationship between parties is short-term or when the issue is not important. It is
            also appropriate when you need more information or facts to make a decision. It is prudent to use this style
            when a situation has the potential to escalate to violence.
            <br /><br /> Some examples of negative avoidance behaviors include:
            <ul>
                <li>Saying the issue isn't important enough to spend time on or to do the topic justice</li>
                <li>Saying things to gloss over differences so they never are discussed</li>
                <li>Focusing on details to the exclusion of the real issues</li>
                <li>Using evasive remarks to avoid sensitive topic or to shift away from a topic</li>
                <li>Joking to distract from the real issues in a conflict</li>

            A win/lose style that some consider negative because party using this style solves the problem at the cost of the other party's
            goals or feelings. However, there are times when this style is appropriate. For example, when you know you are
            right, or when the stakes are too high and/or the situation too critical and/or the relationship is not important
            enough to use collaboration.
            <br /><br /> Some examples of negative competitive behaviors include:
            <ul>
                <li>Lying, concealing one's own goals and/or interests</li>
                <li>Verbal attacks, while pushing one’s own agenda</li>
                <li>Being hostile toward other party (or at least pretending to be)</li>

            Compromise is a give and take of resources. The classic compromise in negotiating is to "split the difference" between two
            positions. When using compromise, each person fails to achieve her or his original goal.
            <br /><br /> Beyond one's overall style for behavior during a conflict, other matters of individual style also
            affect perceptions during conflicts. For example, we each have a preferred style of thinking (problem-solving,
            decision-making, and managing change). When there is a cognitive gap between your preferred style and the other
            person’s style, conflict is almost inevitable. Just by becoming aware of your preferred style of conflict management,
            you have taken a giant step forward in your ability to mitigate or even prevent conflict.
            <br /><br /> Although differences in style contribute to conflict, so does either party’s degree of verbal aggressiveness,
            listening behaviors, and other nonverbal or linguistic characteristics.
            <br /><br /> An effective leader is one who prefer collaboration, but also recognizes that timing or conditions
            may not always allow for collaboration. In these situations, the skillful leader is adept at matching the right
            style of conflict management to the situation and in a civilized, do not harm manner.
            <br /><br /> Most people develop a patterned response to conflict based on their interactions with other while
            growing up. Your patterned response may fit some situations well, but may be ineffective or even destructive
            in other circumstances. Therefore, the goal of this instrument and corresponding lesson is to increase your awareness
            of your own patterns to help you recognize that you have choices in how to respond to conflict and, as a result,
            reflect on and improve your responses. Since each style has a preferred way of interacting with others in conflict,
            your newfound awareness can greatly assist you in meeting the needs of the people you live and work with (subordinates,
            peers, supervisors, family, and community).

            The e-CMSPE was developed by Mr. Rich Rafferty and Dr. Stephen Harris at the Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, United
            States Air Force. It provides only a general estimate of your preferred style of conflict management. A more
            specific and psychometrically accurate evaluation of your conflict management style preference can be obtained
            through any number of fee-based instruments. The Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, which is considered
            the gold standard is available on a pay-per-use basis.
